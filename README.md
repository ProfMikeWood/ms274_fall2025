# MS 274 Fall 2025

Welcome to my ocean modeling repository! This repo is designed to be an example for the MS 274 course taught at the Moss Landing Marine Labs in Fall 2025.

There are two key directories in this repository: 

## homework
The homework directory is for storing, managing, and turning in weekly homework assignments

## project
The project directory for storing files for the final project in this course. The project directory will be created in week 8 and continually updated through the end of the course.
